        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A great chicken burger recipe! Natasha is my eldest daughter, and her eyes light up when I announce we're having these for dinner. While my husband and I eat one or two each, she easily finishes at least three. The onion can be finely chopped, but with three kids, we prefer grating it so as to hide it. I usually serve these with mashed potatoes and Caesar salad for a very comforting meal!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound extra-lean ground chicken</li>
            <li>½ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, divided</li>
            <li>½ small onion, finely grated</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix ground chicken, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, onion, egg, and garlic in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.  </li>
            <li>Moisten hands and shape chicken mixture, 2 tablespoons at a time, into flat, oval-shaped patties.</li>
            <li>Spread remaining 1/4 cup bread crumbs in a shallow dish. Dip patties in bread crumbs to coat. </li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Cook patties in hot oil until deeply browned on the bottoms, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn patties and cook until other sides are browned, 3 to 4 minutes more. </li>
        </ol>
